		<p class="primero">Welcome to Phoenix SRV!<br></p> <p class="segundo">After a long wait, we are officially active! We hope you enjoy our server!</p>
		<br><br>
		
		<p>Hi! Welcome to the official website of Phoenix SRV. Surely you are here because you have seen our trailer about the server and it has interested you, because you want to spend some time playing Minecraft with more people on the server without having to pay anything, and/or because you want to talk to people to make new friends, or simply to spend the time. If so, let me tell you that you are in the right place.</p>
		<br>

		<p class="tercero">About us?</p> <br>
		<p>We are a duo with one goal in mind, to create a server and bring people together while enjoying a dedicated server. We are @Adrillox919 and 	@Ewan1011. We are programmers in training. <br> - The page has been created by @Adrillox919. <br> - The Bot has been created by @Ewan1011. <br>- The server has been created by @Adrillox919 and @Ewan1011.</p>
		<br>
		
		<p class="cuarto">What we offer?</p> <br>
		<p>We offer a totally free Minecraft server and also 24/7 so you can play whenever you want, alone or with your friends.
			Also within the game we offer a variety of bonuses or events. For example, if a player has been playing the server for 3 weeks, he will be rewarded with random materials, even hard-to-extract materials. As for Discord, we offer an interaction with our own bot, created by @Ewan1011, talks on the different channels we have created, and even meeting areas (which will have to be requested to use them) and games areas, to meet people and play different games.</p>
